# Machine Learning Project Review

The focus of my studies is knowledge extraction from natural language - with the focus of automated reasoning. 

While  there  have  been  noteworthy  advancements  in  the field  of  natural  language  understanding  during  recent  yearsâ€”  e.g.   commonsense  transformer  models  [8]  it  is  acknowl-edged  that  question-answering  systems  that  relying  purelyon vector-based approaches struggle with answering questionsbased on commonsense knowledge.  The most obvious short-coming for vector-based models is a lack of transparency andinterpretability  [6]  while  performing  inference.   The  resultsobtained may be caused either by actual correlations but alsodue to superficial cues that have been demonstrated to existin commonsense reasoning benchmarks [13]





Your project should be related to a real world problem and should use non generated datasets.

1. Present corresponding datasets and provide corresponding references. NB! All the datasets should be nonconfidential.

2. Explain necessity to use Machine Learning.

3. Proposed solution should include at least 
   three different Machine Learning techniques
   	whereas one should belong to the area of unsupervised learning and 
   	one to the area of supervised learning. (Unless otherwise agreed
   with your teacher!)
4. Demonstrate working implementation.
5. Please keep in mind all the steps of Machine Learning workflow.
6. Interpret achieved results.
7. During examination date answer any question regarding your project and course.
